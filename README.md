# Bank Loan Analysis(Interactive Dashboard Creating Using Power BI )

## Project Objective
I Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key KPIs such as total applications, funded amounts, average interest rates, Debt-to-Income (DTI), and loan performance trends. Utilized Power Query and advanced DAX functions to derive actionable insights and create dynamic visualizations.

# Process
1.	Problem Understanding: Analyzed the bank loan data to identify key metrics like loan applications, funded amounts, DTI, and approval rates.
2.	Data Collection and Cleaning: Collected data, cleaned it using Power BI (handling missing values and correcting data types).
3.	Data Modeling: Imported data into Power BI and created relationships between tables for accurate analysis.
4.	Building Visualizations: Created interactive charts to display loan metrics, including funded vs. unfunded loans, loan amounts, and approval rates.
5.	Advanced Analytics: Used DAX for calculated measures like loan approval rates and average funded amounts.
6.	Dashboard Design: Focused on UX design, ensuring the dashboard was visually appealing and easy to navigate with dynamic filters.

## Project Insight 
# Approval Rate Analysis: 
The dashboard allows users to explore the loan approval rates by region, loan amount, and other factors, providing insights into trends and patterns.
# Loan Performance Metrics:
Key metrics such as funded amounts, total applications, and average interest rates are visualized to help assess the overall health of the loan portfolio.
## Dynamic Filters: 
Users can filter data by various dimensions (e.g., loan status, region) to gain specific insights into loan performance across different segments.
Trends Over Time: Visualizations show how loan approval rates and amounts have changed over time, identifying potential seasonality or other factors affecting performance.
## Risk Assessment:
The dashboard helps identify riskier loans by analyzing metrics like DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio), providing insights into loan quality.
## Actionable Insights: 
The analysis supports data-driven decisions by offering visual insights into the bank's loan portfolio, highlighting areas for improvement or focus.
